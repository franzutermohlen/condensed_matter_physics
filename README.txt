This is a repository of code for performing numerical calculations and simulations to study the physical behavior of certain magnetic and electronic systems within the framework of quantum mechanics and classical mechanics.

There is also some code for plotting the results of certain analytical calculations.

(Note: I have personally written all of this code from scratch, so there may be mistakes!)
